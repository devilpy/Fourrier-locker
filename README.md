# Fourrier-locker
A desktop app to hide passwords and other sensitive data inside audio files.
It is basically a steganographic approach to hiding information. A better way compared to basic encryption.
The fourier_locker file includes the code for creating an audio file with information embedded in it.
The fourier_unlocker file contains code for retrieving the password off of an audio file created via the fourier locker.
The audio_analysis file handles all the audio data management and modification.
the tkinter file contains all the above mentioned code arranged among tkinter gui code to provide a user friend program to hide and extract information. 
I used the funny.wav file to test and it worked well.
To make the program only accessible by its user,(and also encrypt the data that we are hiding for further safety) , I have used certain features of the users voice. So currently it is important to have a a speech segment of yours to access and encrypt information in the program.
